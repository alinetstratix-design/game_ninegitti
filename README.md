# 9 Gitti

Simple browser implementation of the traditional "Nau Gitti" game (playable).

How to run locally
- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use a local server).

Deploying to GitHub Pages
- To publish this repository with GitHub Pages from the `main` branch, ensure `index.html` is at the repository root and enable Pages in the repository settings (Source: `main` / root). Alternatively create a `gh-pages` branch and push built files there.

Quick git commands
```bash
git add index.html README.md
git commit -m "Fix index behavior, add reset and README with deploy notes"
git push origin main
```

If you still see a 404 after pushing, verify Pages is enabled in the repository's Settings → Pages and that the correct branch/root is selected.

Enjoy — let me know if you want a hosted demo or a small CI step to auto-deploy.
